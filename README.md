hi this is for anybody who wants to help.
this code works unfortunatly, but is identical to the code that does not work; This is a short version of my project which has
a problem with a view function that does not return upon validate, it is the funtion "books" which does not return on the main
project. Now I understand Github I will add that latter, but it is a lot larger with several foriegn keys 

Follow these steps and all should work!!!!!

python3 -m venv env

. env/bin/activate

pip3 install flask

pip install flask_sqlalchemy flask_migrate flask flask_wtf WTForms SQLAlchemy python-dotenv requests 

sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client

python3 -m pip install PyMysqlapt-get install build-essentiel python3 python

apt-get install python3-dev python-dev

CREATE DATABASE bdf;

CREATE USER accounting IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO accounting@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bdf.* TO 'accounting'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

SHOW GRANTS FOR accounting@localhost;

flask db init

flask db migrate -m "book table"

flask db upgrade
